# Governance

This repository is jointly governed by a technical
committee, commonly referred to as the "TC."

Initial membership invitations to the TC were given to individuals who had
been active contributors to Node. Current membership is:

```
Fedor Indutny (@indutny)
Trevor Norris (@trevnorris)
Ben Noordhuis (@bnoordhuis)
Isaac Z. Schlueter (@isaacs)
Nathan Rajlich (@TooTallNate)
Bert Belder (@piscisaureus)
TJ Fontaine (@tjfontaine)
Alexis Campailla (@orangemocha)
```

Additionally the TC may invite persons or representatives from certain projects
to participate in a non-voting capacity. These invitees currently are:

* A representative from [build](https://github.com/node-forward/build) chosen
by that project.

The TC has final authority over this project including:

* Project governance and process
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting

The TC can change its governance model if they deem it necessary. The current
governance rules are:

* [Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
* Motions with voting when consensus cannot be reached.
* Quorum of 2/3 (66%), simple definite majority wins.
* No more than 1/3 (34%) of the TC membership can be affiliated with the same
employer.

## TC Meetings

The TC meets weekly on a Google hangout. The meeting is run by a designated
moderator, currently `Mikeal Rogers (@mikeal)`. Each meeting should be
published to Youtube.
